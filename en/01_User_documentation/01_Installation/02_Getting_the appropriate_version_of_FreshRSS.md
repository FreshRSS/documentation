FreshRSS has three different releases or branches. Each branch has its own release frequency. So it is better if you spend some time to understand the purpose of each release.

## Stable release

This release is done when we consider that our goal concerning the new features and the stability is reached. It could happen that we make two releases in a really short time if we have a really good coding pace. In reality, we are all working on our spare time, so we release every few months. But this version is really stable, tested thoroughly and you should not face any major bugs.

## Beta release

This release is done one a regular basis. Every month, we release new features and bug fixes so you can report what can or should be improved. The code is not as thoroughly tested so you can experience some major bugs but we do our best to deliver a day-to-day usable application. In that release, you can use the latest features fairly quickly.

## Development release

As its name suggests, it is the working release for developers. **This release is unstable!** If you want to keep track of enhancements on a daily basis, you can use it. But keep in mind that you need to follow the branch activity on Github (via [the branch RSS feed](https///github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/commits/dev.atom) for instance). Some say that the main developers use it on a daily basis without problem. They may know what they are doingâ€¦
